# Creating a Github Account

The local repository you created on your machine will track the versions of your files as you change them but that's about it. If you want to share them so that other people can review or update them, you'll need to add them to a remote repository. And this is what we'll be doing by setting up a Github account.

To create a Github account:

1. Navigate to [https://github.com][a951cead], enter a username, email address and passowrd, then click **Sign up for Github**.
2. Choose the account type you want (if you are not sure go for _Free_), and click **Continue**.
3. Provide the info on your programming experience, what you want to use Github for, and the technologies that interest you. Click **Submit** when you are ready.
4. Git hub will send you an email to verify your address. Click the **verify email address** link in the message.

   The Github site will open in a browser window.
