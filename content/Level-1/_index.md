# Why Git?

Most Documentation teams use some kind of content versioning system to ensure that they keep track of changes and can roll back changes if need be. Content versioning software like Perforce or SVN generally use a repository on a network server that writers can check working copies of docs in and out of.

Git is a superior version control system but it has other features that allow it to move beyond more traditonal systems like SVN or Perforce. When linked to it's cloud-based repository system **Github**, it offers a range of collaboration, build and publishing options, that are much more difficult to replicate with more traidtional version control software.

Versioning your docs with Git and storing them using Github, gives information developers access to the same development work flows as code developers. Docs teams can work more easily in Agile environments and provide documentation that is continuously integrated along with the software it describes.
